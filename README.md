NeuroSca is a proof-of-concept HTTP server written in Scala. By no means is it even close for production use â€” it's merely an exploration of Scala syntax, features, actor model and performance.


Performance
-----------

The benchmarks were conducted on quad core i5 machine after warming up JVM.

Caveats
-------

All the things! Due to the server being totally careless when operating on sockets, it's a common issue of OS closing the application with "too many open files (ports)" message or resetting the connection. As mentioned above, this project is just an exploration of Scala.

Bonus
-----

Scala language has a fantastic feature called pattern matching. Just hit `/version` or `/multiply/3/9` - it's just like Django's urls.py but built in your language. Have a look at [another example](https://gist.github.com/2668943): a simple REPL reacting on certain commands.
